# Retrospectives Weekly Log

## Week 3 Retrospectives:
### What went well
• Scrum master assigned tasks well  
• Collaboration between the team on various tasks e.g., Rumaysa & Anika working on Figma design  
• Frequent meetings allowed for the workflow of the week to be smooth  
• Figma design updated with a cleaner visual  
• Code for Figma design is making good progress  
• Registrations prototype page working, thanks to Yurii  
• Initial logo was designed by Lorenzo  
### What to improve
• **Meeting time** was dragged out in one case which lead to an extensive meeting, delaying our professor for a lecture  
• Team members currently have a disjointed idea of features and their idea of functionality is not matching yet.  
• Lack of a proper document explaining our project with functionality requirements, lit review.  
• Maintaining a regular throughput of work rather than a few chosen condensed work days.    
### What actions are being taken
• Clearer meeting schedules with duration predefined. End result has a list of action points and members assigned with deadlines  
• For each new feature implemented, a document will be created listing how it should would and how it's implemented.  
• Weekly feedback is also playing a large part in the development and design  
• Create a detailed project proposal document with functional requirements, technical architecture, lit review and methodology.  


## Week 4 Retrospectives:
### What went well  
• Tasks were assigned to individuals well  
• Once again, good collaboration where needed e.g., feedback & task assistance  
• Detailed meetings provided clarity and kept the group on track  
• Figma was once again improved after the feedback given from the presentation  
• Coding process of the pages is coming along well  
• AI and its functionality is also improving
• Tasks are now being done more consistently throughout the weeks 
### What to improve  
• Still need to improve on documentation of our tasks  
• The UI design has minor disagreements of where some sections should be   
• AI is yet to be fully selected  
### What actions are being taken  
• Additional diagrams are being made for use-cases and the technical architecture  
• Additional sketches are being drawn to speed up the process of changes rather than full Figma re-designs  
• Discussions of budget and benefits of the AI are being finalised
