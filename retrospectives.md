# Retrospectives Weekly Log

## Week 3 Retrospectives:
### What went well
• Scrum master assigned tasks well  
• Collaboration between the team on various tasks e.g., Rumaysa & Anika working on Figma design  
• Frequent meetings allowed for the workflow of the week to be smooth  
• Figma design updated with a cleaner visual  
• Code for Figma design is making good progress  
• Registrations prototype page working, thanks to Yurii  
• Initial logo was designed by Lorenzo  
### What to improve
• **Meeting time** was dragged out in one case which lead to an extensive meeting, delaying our professor for a lecture  
• Team members currently have a disjointed idea of features and their idea of functionality is not matching yet.  
• Lack of a proper document explaining our project with functionality requirements, lit review.  
• Maintaining a regular throughput of work rather than a few chosen condensed work days.    
### What actions are being taken
• Clearer meeting schedules with duration predefined. End result has a list of action points and members assigned with deadlines  
• For each new feature implemented, a document will be created listing how it should would and how it's implemented.  
• Weekly feedback is also playing a large part in the development and design  
• Create a detailed project proposal document with functional requirements, technical architecture, lit review and methodology.
